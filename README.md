## ✨ What is AI Resume Assistant?

**AI Resume Assistant** is a smart AI web application that lets you upload any **resume or PDF document** and ask questions like:

- “What skills are mentioned?”
- “Summarize this resume”
- “What projects does this person have?”
- “What technologies are used?”

It doesn’t guess.  
It **reads your document, understands it, and answers from it** using **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**.

---

## 🧠 How it Works (Like Real AI Systems)


Instead of sending the whole document to AI, the system:
1. Breaks the PDF into small pieces
2. Converts them into vectors (embeddings)
3. Finds only the relevant parts
4. Sends them to the AI for answering  

This is how **ChatGPT, Copilot & Gemini** do document Q&A.
